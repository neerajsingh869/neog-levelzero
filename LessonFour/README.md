## Lesson Four of NeoG camp
---
1. Learnings from Lesson Four
    - Used `alert` to show output and  `prompt` to take input
    - Used `querySelector()` function to reference a particular element in HTML
    - Used `addEventListener(<event_name>, callback)` to attach event listener on a particular element in HTML.
    - Learnt difference between `innerHTML` and `innerText`. `innerHTML` is used to put html code inside an element while `innerText` is used to put text inside an element.
